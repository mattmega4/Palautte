# Palautte

Free on the App Store.

Palautte lets you customize a color and assign it to text or a shape and then place it on top of a solid color of your choosing. This helps you see how two colors really harmonize on the same screen you will be developing for.

You can tweak both the background and foreground colors to find the right harmony. When you find the color harmony your are looking for the RGB values are presented in a simple manner for you to use in your designs.

You can save this Palautte to your phone, and organize them for future reference.
